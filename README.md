# TODO
### So much todo, so little time.

Objectives: 
* Build a simple client-side to-do list app using Backbone.js
* Demonstrate HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge and understanding of UI/UX concerns

As my first app built in Backbone.js, I wanted to create a minimal yet intuitive app. The app consists of a model with entries that have two data attributes: description (string) and completed (boolean). The app implements basic CRUD operations: creating a new to-do item, viewing it, editing and updating it (by double-clicking on the text and checking/unchecking the checkbox), and deleting it (by clicking on the 'X'). To view how to do these, I created a 'Shortcuts' feature that will display these commands. 

Data is persistent through local storage, allowing users to add, modify, and save each to-do items. Users can see how many more to-do items are remaining, and have the ability to mark (and unmark) all to-do items as complete. In order to view the app, simply download the files and open the index.html file.
